Express.js is a minimal and flexible Node.js web application framework that provides a robust set of features for web and mobile applications. Here’s a comprehensive guide to get you started with your Express.js application.

Steps to Create an Express.js Application
Setting GET request route on the root URL
Setting up one more get request route on the ‘/hello’ path. 
Setting route to be accessed by users to send data with post requests.
Steps to Create an Express.js Application
Building an Express.js application is the foundation of server-side development in Node.js. To take your skills further and learn how to create robust full-stack apps using Express and React, the Full Stack Development with Node JS course provides a comprehensive guide from setup to deployment.

Here are the detailed steps to create an express.js application

Step 1: Write this command to create a NodeJS application in your terminal because our express server will work inside the node application.
npm init
This will ask you for a few configurations about your project you can fill them in accordingly, also you can change them later from the package.json file. 

Note: Use ‘npm init -y’ for default initialization

Step 2: Install the necessary dependencies for our application. In this, we will install express.js dependency.

npm install express
Something like this will be shown on successful installation.

Step 3: Create an app.js (or server.js) file. This will serve as the main entry point for your application.

Project Structure:


The updated dependencies in package.json file will look like:

"dependencies": {
    "express": "^4.19.2",
    "mongoose": "^8.4.0"
  }
Approach
Use require(‘express’) to import the Express module.
Call express() to create an Express application instance.
Define the port for the application, typically 3000.
Set up a basic GET route with app.get(‘/’, (req, res) => res.send(‘Hello World!’)).
Use app.listen method to listen to your desired PORT and to start the server.
Example: Implementation to setup the express application.


const express = require('express');

const app = express();
const PORT = 3000;

app.listen(PORT, (error) =>{
    if(!error)
        console.log("Server is Successfully Running, 
                   and App is listening on port "+ PORT)
    else 
        console.log("Error occurred, server can't start", error);
    }
);
Step to Run Application: Run the application using the following command from the root directory of the project

node app.js
Output: You will see something like this on the terminal.

Screenshot-2024-06-06-160044
Now with all of this, we have created and run the server successfully, if your server is not starting then there may be some error, try to analyze and read that error and resolve it accordingly. 
Finally, after a successful run if you try to open the URL (localhost:3000) on the browser it will show you cannot GET / because we have not configured any route on this application yet.  

Step 4: Now we will set all the routes for our application.
Routes are the endpoints of the server, which are configured on our backend server and whenever someone tries to access those endpoints they respond accordingly to their definition at the backend. If you’re a beginner you can consider route as a function that gets called when someone requests the special path associated with that function and return the expected value as a response. We can create routes for HTTP methods like get, post, put, and so on. 

Syntax:
The basic syntax of these types of routes looks like this, the given function will execute when the path and the request method resemble.Creating an Express.js application involves several steps that guide you through setting up a basic server to handle complex routes and middleware.
